    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hdfs://namenode:9000</value>
    <description>
       URL that specifies the default filesystem used by clients.
       Use the form hdfs://hostname:port where hostname and port are the machine and port on which the namenode 
       daemon runs and listens. This parameter serves double duty in that it also informs the namenode as to which 
       IP and port it should bind. Datanodes heartbeat to this hostname and port as well.

  <property>
    <name>io.file.buffer.size</name>
    <value>65536</value>
    <description>
       Used as a general purpose buffer size. Larger buffers tend to result in more efficient data transfer, 
       either from disk or during network operations, at the cost of increased memory consumption and latency. 
       This property should be set to a multiple of the system page size, defined in bytes, and is 4KB by default.
       A value of 64KB (65536 bytes) is a good starting point.
